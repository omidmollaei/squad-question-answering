Implement a question-answering (QA) neural network and train it on Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) in tensorflow. For this, the model first process context (main paragraph which the related question is extracted from) by using self-attention and dense layers. Second the model process the question using a bidirectional GRU layer. The results from processed context and processed question are fed into a cross-attention block and finally the answers are produced.
